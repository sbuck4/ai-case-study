next-generation AI capabilities into web 3*

While this is a very large web 3 & NFT project, I believe te product that is being built will have a competitiveness with other in app models, mainly in communication type applications.

## USE CASE 

While still in beta, they have desgined a multilingual model to pull information from a handful of langauges, i.e discord rules when joining channel, for users to help break langauge barriers for everyone to be able to connect.

This is intended to be implemented into discord channels(in beta here currently), telegram as well as a web app in development.

I happened to stumble upon this which sparked my interest in AI, so I don't know of any competitor's to speak of as I am new to a lot!
