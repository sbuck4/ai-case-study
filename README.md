# Hyzen.ai 

- Hyzen ai was established in the summer of 2022

- Hive DAO and Hyzen ai founded Hyzen

- Funding came via sale of NFTs, called Hashpimps 
    as well as the release if $HAI, which was majority airdrop to holders

> *The Hyzen AI project spearheads a revolution by introducing
next-generation AI capabilities into web 3*

## USE CASE 

While still in beta, they have designed a multilingual model to pull information from a handful of languages, i.e discord rules when a joining channel, for users who aren't fluent in said server's language. This feature is currently free to use in live demo for a month in your own discord server if you are wanting to check it out! I believe it is a matter of time before they have a  voice language-to-different language model in realtime live chats. Which could be potentially incredible.

Hyzen also includes: 
1. Natural language processing (NLP), 
2. Test-to-speech transformation (TTS), 
3. Text-to-image generation (TTI), 
4. Text-to-video production (TTXV) and 
5. Text-to-music (TTM). 

As well as many more things in development.
Hyzen has a dedicated discord server for beta testing. Plans for this to be made useable in Telegram, as well as having a web app.

I do think majority of applications are seeking or are already moving to AI, whether that be they make their own or find what they're looking for. Hyzen competes with all major models, and since it isn't a product of a big tech company it may be a lot harder for it to gain tread.

## Landmarks

> When Hyzen launched, Hashpimps were minting for 240 hbar (~$24 today), and have appreciated to a floor price of ~3500 hbar ($350 today) with the release of their multilingual model. There next major landmark will be the release of STY-NFT (Speak-to-your-NFT) which I'm unsure of my thoughts on this, but could be pivotal for an ever evolving web3. 

## Recommendations for Market Success

- **Strategic Marketing**: Once the model is fully finished, effort needs to be made for marketing campaigns to raise awareness of Hyzen and help adopt more users.

- **Continuing to Innovate**: Just keep going!
